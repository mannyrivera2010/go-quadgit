# **Go-to-Market Strategy**

 **Phase 1: Foundation & Community Building (Months 0-6)**

*   **Launch:** Open-source 100% of the core `quad-db` engine and CLI. The source code is the best marketing to the developer community.
*   **Content Marketing:**
    *   Publish the **"Graph Git" book** chapter by chapter on the project's website/blog. This establishes thought leadership and serves as the primary documentation.
    *   Write articles for targeted publications (e.g., "Implementing Git-like Merging for RDF Data," "Optimizing BadgerDB for Graph Workloads").
*   **Community:** Be active on Hacker News, relevant subreddits (r/golang, r/semanticweb), and create a public Discord/Slack for early adopters.

 **Phase 2: Productization & Early Adopters (Months 6-12)**

*   **Launch "Graph Git Cloud":** A managed, hosted version of the `quad-db-server`. This is the primary commercial product.
    *   **Freemium Model:** Offer a generous free tier for individuals and small projects (e.g., 1 namespace, 2 users, up to 1M quads). This is the primary lead generation funnel.
    *   **Team/Enterprise Tiers:** Paid tiers that offer more namespaces, users, advanced security features (SSO/OAuth), and enterprise support.
*   **Target Early Adopters:** Focus on startups and teams in bioinformatics, fintech, and digital humanities—fields where data lineage and complexity are high. Offer deep discounts and direct engineering support in exchange for case studies.

 **Phase 3: Scaling & Enterprise Sales (Months 12+)**

*   **Develop Enterprise Features:** Build out features specifically for the Enterprise tier, such as advanced ABAC policies, integrations with identity providers like Okta, and dedicated cluster hosting options.
*   **Content Marketing 2.0:** Publish case studies from early adopters. "How BioCorp uses Graph Git to Version Genomic Knowledge" or "FinTech Inc. Passes Audits with Cryptographically Signed Data History."
*   **Outbound Sales:** Build a small sales team to target enterprise data architects and CTOs at larger companies, using the security, governance, and auditability messaging.
*   **Partnerships:** Partner with data consulting firms and systems integrators who can recommend and implement Graph Git for their clients.
